# My Completed Projects Repository
Hello, and welcome to my repository!

## AdventureHunt-Front-End
This folder contains all of the files necessary to run a front end that I designed. It utilizes the Amadeus Travel Search API to provide users with an exploratory travel search experience. The user can explore flights, cars, and hotels listed by price. At the moment, the project is not connected to the "real" API (that will be the next step of the project). Instead, it only displays the data in the api.js file -- my "fake" API.

## Autocompleter.java
This program utilizes ternary search trees and allows a user to apply numerous methods to a stored list of words, including recieving an "autocompleted" word based on some prefix that a user might enter (for instance, if the user inputs "c" and asks for an autocomplete, they might get back "cat" if it is stored within the autocompleter). This code demonstrates my expertise with the tree data structure (I got 100% on this project!)

## GamePlay.cs
This file includes the code wherein the central gameplay functionality is stored for a game I designed in Unity called Scopa. Scopa itself is an Italian card game that relies heavily on both logic and luck (rules can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopa !). While several other classes were utilized in the final game, this class holds the central logic and functionality code for the game overall. Be warned -- the class for which this was the final project was graded entirely on code functionality, so the cleanliness of the code was not necessarily of high priority. Also, let it be known that I was the only Sophomore among the 15 or so students in this upper-division class, and I received an A for my work! :)

## LinkedYarn.java
This code creates a linked list of Yarn objects. Now, a Yarn is an unordered collection of Strings in which duplicates are allowed. A Yarn maps Strings to the number of occurrences of each String in the Yarn. For instance, the sentence "I think I like quesadillas" could be converted to the yarn { "I": 2 , "think": 1 , "like" : 1, "quesadillas" : 1 }. The size of a Yarn is the number of total words stored in it (in this case, 5), while the uniqueSize is the number of unique words in the Yarn (in this case, 4). In this program, each Yarn is represented as a linked list in which each Node of the list contains a String (the word) as well as the number of occurrences of that String. As you will see, many different methods are created and can be used in this program. This work demonstrates my developing expertise in Java programming, as well as my flourishing understanding of Data Structures (this was one of the first projects I completed in my Data Structures class).

## rotating_scene.cpp
This file contains the C++ necessary to create and rotate a 3D graphical scene. This project was completed in the second semester of my Junior year of college in my Computer Graphics class, which dealt heavily with the mathematical theory behind computer graphics.
