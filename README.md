# My Completed Projects Repository
Hello, and welcome to my repository!

## Autocompleter.java
This program utilizes ternary search trees and allows a user to apply numerous methods to a stored list of words, including recieving an "autocompleted" word based on some prefix that a user might enter (for instance, if the user inputs "c" and asks for an autocomplete, they might get back "cat" if it is stored within the autocompleter). This code demonstrates my expertise with the tree data structure (I got 100% on this project!)

## Falling.js
This file includes JavaScript code that I wrote in my first-ever programming class. The program creates a small game in which the user uses their mouse to control a little elf. The goal is to catch as many falling presents as possible before running out of lives. Red presents are worth 10 points, green are worth 20, gold are worth 50, and rainbow are worth 100. 500 points are added to the score every time the user catches 10 presents in a row. The user has a total of five lives, and every time they miss a present, one life is spent. The user may click start to begin the game and stop to pause the game. To re-start the game, the user must refresh the page. (Credit to Michael Simmons for being my partner in this project and to John Dionisio for the canvas starter code). This program shows the level of understanding I was able to reach within only a semester of Computer Science exposure.

## Falling.html
This file includes the HTML code for the Falling game.

## Falling.css
This file includes the CSS code for the Falling game.

## GamePlay.cs
This file includes the code wherein the central gameplay functionality is stored for a game I designed in Unity called Scopa. Scopa itself is an Italian card game that relies heavily on both logic and luck (rules can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopa !). While several other classes were utilized in the final game, this class holds the central logic and functionality code for the game overall. Be warned -- the class for which this was the final project was graded entirely on code functionality, so the cleanliness of the code was not necessarily of high priority. Also, let it be known that I was the only Sophomore among the 15 or so students in this upper-division class, and I received an A for my work! :)

## LinkedYarn.java
This code creates a linked list of Yarn objects. Now, a Yarn is an unordered collection of Strings in which duplicates are allowed. A Yarn maps Strings to the number of occurrences of each String in the Yarn. For instance, the sentence "I think I like quesadillas" could be converted to the yarn { "I": 2 , "think": 1 , "like" : 1, "quesadillas" : 1 }. The size of a Yarn is the number of total words stored in it (in this case, 5), while the uniqueSize is the number of unique words in the Yarn (in this case, 4). In this program, each Yarn is represented as a linked list in which each Node of the list contains a String (the word) as well as the number of occurrences of that String. As you will see, many different methods are created and can be used in this program. This work demonstrates my developing expertise in Java programming, as well as my flourishing understanding of Data Structures (this was one of the first projects I completed in my Data Structures class).
