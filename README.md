Hello, and welcome to my repository!

## Intzilla.java
Intzilla is a program that I wrote for my CMSI 186 class. It allows various functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, greater than, less than, and equals) to be done on arbitrarily large integers -- that is, these functions may be done to integers that contain up to Integer.MAX_INT digits!

## Factorial.java
This program allows a user to input an Intzilla in the command line and outputs the factorial value of that Intzilla.

## Fibonacci.java
This program allows a user to input some Intzilla "n" in the command line and outputs the value of the "nth" term of the Fibonacci sequence.

## Falling.js
This file includes the code that creates a small game for the user to play! In this game, the user uses their mouse to control a little elf. The goal is to catch as many falling presents as possible before running out of lives. Red presents are worth 10 points, green are worth 20, gold are worth 50, and rainbow are worth 100. 500 points are added to the score every time the user catches 10 presents in a row. The user has a total of five lives, and every time they miss a present, one life is spent. The user may click start to begin the game and stop to pause the game. To re-start the game, the user must refresh the page. (Credit to Michael Simmons for being my partner in this project).
