Hello, and welcome to my repository!

## Intzilla.java
Intzilla is a program that I wrote for my CMSI 186 class. It allows various functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, greater than, less than, and equals) to be done on arbitrarily large integers -- that is, these functions may be done to integers that contain up to Integer.MAX_INT digits!

## Factorial
This program allows a user to input an Intzilla in the command line outputs the factorial value of that Intzilla.

## Fibonacci
This program allows a user to input some Intzilla "n" in the command line and outputs the value of the "nth" term of the Fibonacci sequence.
